# CS Picks

**CS Picks** is a JavaScript-based web application for exploring Computer Science professors and schools. It is an accompanying tool to the PhD Demystify book (https://github.com/dynaroars/phd-cs-us), which helps prospective student navigate the PhD admission process in the US.  CSPicks uses data from [CSrankings](https://github.com/emeryberger/CSrankings), DBLP, and Open Alex to provide an interface for searching faculty publications and analyzing school strengths.

## 🚀 Features

- **Search by Name**: Instantly find professors by name.
- **Publication Stats**: View a breakdown of publication counts by research area, sorted by volume.
- **Activity Graph**: Visual timeline of publications per year.
- **Direct Links**: Quick access to the professor's:
    - **Homepage**
    - **Google Scholar Profile**
    - **DBLP Profile**

### 3. Historical Mode
- **Toggle Historical Affiliations**: When enabled, publications are credited to the institution where the author was affiliated at the time of publication (via OpenAlex data).

### 4. Ranking Simulator
